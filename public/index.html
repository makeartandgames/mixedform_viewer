<p><em>February 19 2014</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">The young girl who works the counter
waves the heat away
calls her friend and counts my bills.
She holds the twenties taut between her fingers
bends her neck back to catch the light,
 so, in the wispy paper, god's eye is
briefly painted gold. Her maple hair, scented,
bleeds its gilded boneless needles
resting wasted forward pleading down
the red and peeling counter wood. She is folding
now unfolding, staring past my eyes.

(she watched it out my hand
I watched it out her stitching eyes
its going out it's slipping gridded lovey lights
lines of christlike painted figures
lines of crystal pitching down her
crystal shedded frame). She’s finished.

Beyond her, tiled walls of blank &amp; white unwanting
products. Somewhere someone dying on a wall.
Figures, squared by measure bars that leap out 
the scoring air--they catch in amber brightlight sigils--
a pointless red infringing hung between us
 there.

you said ‘a while’ I dreamt you nothing said
I crept back the small and parted rocks
like loveless beetles marching scattered
steadying my head--you said 'a while' I dreamt I heard you
quiet said I saw you halfway from my side I saw
you well that day you said 'a little while'
and there it went

Elanor would say. For Elanor Vance 
was thirty-two when she drove 
the car in which her father
died, and ever since, she had lived
by revelation, in the lean
bitter-edged world which begets
such truth. Can you see it? She would say 
to the counter girl,
who slim as a whippet passing
at a swift walk on a tangential way
by the beggars, gave nothing up,
but planned a speech:
Mother, you see, flesh will not keep, 
time’s pocket is picked; the lock-­
shaken lute strings jig no music mute
from their wooden womb and I
am twenty-three now, and slaved
to wants I call my own and hold a deed
to hell with my printed name 
and need you very little, anymore.

<pre><code class="hljs">“I couldn’t tell you why, or what I need, but I could tell you what it’s like: 
it’s like welcoming an estranged friend into your home after a long and 
terrible fight. You ignore past misdeeds and awkwardness, and put an
 end to anything that gets in the way. So much just becomes nonsense.
 One can be given back an awareness forgotten since one's birth. It lasts 
a while . . . and even then, I can seem to be human, analog to the ones 
closest--who become pretty happily blind.”

<p><em>January 4 2019</em></p>
<pre><code class="hljs">“They strung my farmland out this telepathics wire--
disclaimed this cold electric death
as if, ‘ah, we meant all this--’
For unkempt dreams tinfoild hats are best.

My grandson slaked a crown of mirrors instead just
a special thing on a special kid. He's dead
they say, well, he's dead special then.
The kids are scared of everything again;
but my daughter, she’s young, she’s well.
She swallowed whole eight-hundred butterflies and didn't choke;
Surrendered in her bloody walls with origami
wings. &amp; only later laid their eggs among her fragile 
limbs. It's true that she can't speak. 
It's true her eyes are fifty hundred lights;
but she's made herself a few good pretty bits
to pin when our summer fields are dim.”

<pre><code class="hljs">In that useless place behind my nose
I keep 150 mils of pure and powder oxy-
codone clinicianed on my daughter. She is used. And mostly dead
and I, I took what I needed and never understood
what was so special about the dying. Let the dead
bury the dead. Envy the last screaming for what it sells,
which is nothing, which is where I would throw my old soul every
morning, but a balletic shitting kite sings over me.
Plus I still sell my time to that antiqued traitor--the foreman,
who drives his kif smile behind two lenses,
comes smooth out his electric lexus 
dark-tinted windows, dark-tinted eyes--
Some day I’ll rise to meet him. Maybe say:
“I am in the holler of contrived shadow
Having zipped this old soul under maps of color
your precious light long ago let loose on
every unmet nook &amp; crafting cranny
every edge case, in every corner—&quot;

of flying through night.
The slippery streets of Amsterdam,
the aquavit that warned me:
now swing wide. Beyond the stars
is one for you and three or four
astride awaits a horse,
plunging through Christmas streets,
in wait for you as ordered by some star
or on the throat of you.
And if it reached you,
miss, you would afterwards decide on
the style in which you wanted it
reported to your self.
The first note? Of all music sung
the first note. Could you
hold your fear it might turn to roses,
to endless reds in more rooms
than you or one like you could ever enter?
It wasn’t fear exactly that she saw
on the faces of mangy
drowning-bellied children playing in dust,
not fear, but something still
in the eyes of the old,
just before or after they dropped dead
and she would pass
through them: the rooms,
the cells, the understanding needle.
If she was afraid to leave her car
it wasn't fear of strangers,
but of finding their blue glances
turned pitilessly inward,届
as all their blued walled rooms
and silent worlds
delivering through their names.
Why did you leave me El’ Lauren?
Something had left her, something. And yet
she was afraid to follow it, afraid
eternity might find some other face.
Father, can you help me find the music
that silver filled my little room
in any still summer afternoon?
